# Custom Events Module

This is a simple Drupal 7 module built for the purposes of illustrating Unit Testing and Functionality Testing.

This module should be used in tandem with the [Customs Event Theme](https://github.com/WidgetsBurritos/custom-events-theme)

**This is by no means a complete module, and should not be relied upon in a production environment. It is solely for educational purposes.
